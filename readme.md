#### Pokedex

### Intro
We received a task to make a working pokedex (click[here](https://lisonallie.github.io/Pokedex/)), this was our second project on api's. To deepen our knowledge, this time we were asked to do all kinds op things with [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/).

### Goals
The objective was to make an app where you would be able to look up any of the 803 Pokémon. You should be able to look it up by name or number, see the sprite, show at least 4 moves and a previous evolution (if it exists) alond with their name and image.
