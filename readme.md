#### Pokedex 📘

### Intro ⚡⚡⚡
We received a task to make a working [pokedex](https://lisonallie.github.io/Pokedex/), this was our second project using an API. To deepen our knowledge, this time we were asked to do several things with [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/). Including: 
- Searching a Pokémon by name or ID #.
- Show ID # of said Pokémon.
- Display an image of the Pokémon.
- Show at least 4 moves of said Pokémon.
- Show the previous evolution of said Pokémon if it existed and display the name of the previous evolution.

### Goals 🔥🔥🔥
The objective was to make an app where you would be able to look up any of the 802 Pokémon provided in the API. You can look up a Pokémon by name or number, see its' sprite, show at least 4 moves and a previous evolution (if it exists) alond with their name and image.

### Features 👓👓🔎
When typing in a number between 1 and 803 or the specific name of the pokémon, the app shows the sprite, as well as the previous evolution if it has one. Regardless of which input type you choose, the app should always give you the name and the number of the pokémon. If you input a number above 802, the window gives an alert that the Pokémon fled.

### More Time ⌛⌛⌛
If we had more time we would love to add an option to view the shiny form of each Pokémon and play more with the visual look of the Pokédex.
